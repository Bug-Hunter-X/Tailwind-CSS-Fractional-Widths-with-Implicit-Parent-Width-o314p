```html
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4">
  <div class="flex space-x-4">
    <div class="w-1/2 bg-blue-500 p-2">
      Div 1
    </div>
    <div class="w-1/2 bg-red-500 p-2">
      Div 2
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's `w-1/2` class to make each div take up half the width. However, this only works if the parent container has a defined width. In this case, the parent is only constrained by the inner content, causing unexpected behavior.
